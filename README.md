# wpscrack
This is a copy of the original code from **Stefan Viehböck**  
The orignal dropbox download is down, the link was posted in Stefan's blog: https://sviehb.wordpress.com/2011/12/27/wi-fi-protected-setup-pin-brute-force-vulnerability/  
**wpscrack** was the first tool that performed WPS PIN brute force attacks.  
It was published the 29th of December 2011.  
It was developed in backtrack with an ar9170 chipset and does not support a lot of devcies.  
It was more conceived as a PoC than as a "final tool"  
All credits for the WPS PIN brute force vulnerability and wpscrack goes to **Stefan Viehböck**
